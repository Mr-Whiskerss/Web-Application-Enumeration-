# Web-Application-Enumeration-Script
Just a basic bash script that combines my most commonly used web application tools scripted together to run in the back ground while performing manual web application enumeration. You will need to change the location of some of the tools directories in this script.
# Tools that need to be installed for this script to work.
* nslookup
* DNSrecon
* Nmap
* WhatWeb
* Curl
* Wfuzz
* Nikto
* TLS Scan

# Up coming changes I wish to make

Add more error handling rather than stop when a tool isnt found the script carries on to the next tool.
Add more tools to find more issues
Maybe output all tool output to a single file for import into reporting tool.
Add a feature to grab java script libaries from web application for further investigation.
